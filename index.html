          <h3>Design & Development</h3>
          <p>
            I started learning how to code when I was 26 years old. Since I was
            a child, I used to love to play with my brother electronic toys and
            open the broke ones to try to fix it. I had always been in love with
            programming language and technology. However, I have not given a
            chance to really learn and enjoy it until I finish my degree in law
            school. Since then, I have been learning how to design and develop
            mobile and web applications.

          <h3>Nature and Learning</h3>
          <p>
            I can say that I have always been curious and fascinated to learn
            how things work! For me, to get fully understand what is going on
            with something, it is essential to know its functions. Besides my
            love for technology and learning, I have a deep love and respect for
            nature. For this reason, camping and hiking are things that make me
            feel relaxed.
